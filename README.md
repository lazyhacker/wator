This is an implementation of the  Wa-Tor (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wa-Tor)
simulation.

I started this project as an exercise for me to learn the
[Go Programming Language](http://golang.org) so there will many newbie mistakes
and non-idiomatic patterns.  This project is probably not much use to anyone
else except maybe to help people realize that there is an even less
knowledgeable gopher out there.
