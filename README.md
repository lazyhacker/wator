I wanted to try learning Go (http://www.golang.org) by writing some small
programs. As this is more about me learning Go, I might just try something for
the sake of learning even if it's not completely necessary.

I decided to implement a Wa-Tor (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wa-Tor), a simple
population dynamic simulator. For now, it uses the terminal to display using
termbox-go. Later on, I'd like to try to do a real GUI app, but this was enough
to get me started.
